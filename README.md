This is a remake of the [Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://github.com/Athma-Vasi/Rock-Paper-Scissors) Odin Project assignment and I used the challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH) as inspiration. Sketch and Figma files were for premium users only, so I used the firefox colour picker tool to get the colours. (≧▽≦)
